# Privacy Policy

**This Privacy Policy applies to GridTimer (package name `com.calcitem.gridtimer`) developed by Calcitem Studio.**  
_Last updated on Jan 1, 2026._

Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and contact us if you have any questions.

## About Us

Calcitem Studio (hereinafter referred to as "Calcitem," "we," "our," or "us") takes your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use GridTimer.

## About This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, store, and protect information in connection with GridTimer.

Under this Privacy Policy, "personal information" means information that can be used—alone or in combination—to directly or indirectly identify an individual. We handle personal information in accordance with this Policy and applicable laws.

## Key Points (Summary)

- **Offline-first:** GridTimer works primarily offline. We do **not** operate a backend service that receives your app data during normal use.
- **No user accounts:** GridTimer does **not** support account registration or login.
- **No ads / no analytics tracking:** We do **not** serve ads and do not integrate analytics SDKs to track you.
- **No automatic uploads:** Crash logs (if any) are stored locally and are sent to us **only** if you choose to email them.

## What Information We Process and Why

### 1. Information Stored Locally on Your Device

GridTimer stores certain information **locally on your device** to provide core functionality, such as:

- Timer configurations (e.g., durations, presets, and user preferences)
- App settings (e.g., language, sound/vibration, TTS preferences)

This local data is not automatically transmitted to us. You can delete this data by uninstalling the App or clearing the App’s storage via your device settings.

### 2. Crash Logs and Diagnostic Information (Local; Optional Sharing)

GridTimer uses **[catcher_2 (Catcher2)](https://pub.dev/packages/catcher_2)** to help diagnose crashes. When an unexpected error occurs, the App may generate crash logs locally (for example, a file named `GridTimer-crash-logs.txt`).

Crash logs may include:

- Error messages and stack traces
- App version and package name
- Device model and operating system version
- Timestamp and other diagnostic information helpful for debugging

**We do not automatically upload crash logs in the background.** If you choose to report a crash, the App will open your email client with a draft message (and may attach or include crash logs). You can review and edit the draft before sending. Data is sent only if you tap “Send” in your email client.

### 3. Information You Choose to Send to Us (Email)

If you contact us or choose to send a crash report by email, we will receive the information you provide, which may include:

- Your email address
- Email content (including any text you enter)
- Attachments you choose to send (which may include the crash log described above)

We use this information to provide support, troubleshoot issues, and improve the App.

---

## How We Share, Transfer, and Disclose Information

We do **not** sell personal information.

We may disclose information only as necessary:

- **With your consent** (for example, when you voluntarily send an email to us)
- **To comply with legal obligations** (for example, a lawful request by authorities)

Because crash reports are sent through the email client and email service you choose, your email provider and client may process your email according to their own policies and terms.

---

## How We Store and Protect Information

- **On-device data:** Timer data and settings are stored locally on your device.
- **Emails you send:** If you email us, your message and attachments will be stored in our support communication systems (for example, our email inbox). We take reasonable measures to protect such information against unauthorized access or disclosure.

No internet communication can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please use caution when sending sensitive information by email.

### Data Retention

We retain emails and crash reports you send only for as long as reasonably necessary to:

- Investigate and fix issues
- Improve the App and user support
- Comply with legal requirements

---

## Your Rights and Choices

- **Choose not to send reports:** You can decline to send a crash report at any time.
- **Request deletion:** If you have voluntarily sent us crash reports or support emails, you may request deletion by contacting us. We will make reasonable efforts to comply where feasible and not prohibited by law.

## Protection of Minors

GridTimer is not directed to children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a minor has provided personal information to us via email, please contact us so we can take appropriate steps.

## Updates to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated Policy will become effective as of the "Last updated" date above.
