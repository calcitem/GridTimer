# Audio Assets

Place your MP3 ringtone files here:

- `bell_01.mp3` - First bell sound
- `bell_02.mp3` - Second bell sound
- `beep_soft.mp3` - Soft beep sound
- `chime.mp3` - Chime sound
- `ding.mp3` - Ding sound
- `gentle.mp3` - Gentle alarm sound

**Requirements:**
- Format: MP3
- Duration: 2-5 seconds (will loop)
- Size: < 100KB each
- License: Must be royalty-free or created by you

**Note:** For Android notification sounds, you must also place the same files in:
`android/app/src/main/res/raw/`

The files in `res/raw/` must use underscores (not hyphens) and no file extension in the filename reference.

## Temporary Placeholder

For testing purposes, you can:
1. Generate simple tones using online tools
2. Use royalty-free sounds from freesound.org
3. Create silent MP3 files for initial testing

Once you have audio files, place them both here and in `android/app/src/main/res/raw/`.
