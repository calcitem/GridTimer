Simple is better. A timer designed for clarity — visual and audible.

If modern apps feel too complicated or standard clocks are hard to read, Grid Timer is made for you. We cut the clutter—no unnecessary animations or menus—so you get what matters: big numbers in a clean 3×3 grid.

Designed for accessibility and ease of use:

* Eye-friendly, soft dark theme with amber text to reduce glare and eye strain
* Clear timer status using both text and color, including colorblind‑friendly labels
* Carefully tuned low‑frequency alarm tone—easier to notice than sharp, high‑pitched beeps
* Optional voice announcements (text‑to‑speech) that clearly say when time is up
* Large, mistake‑proof Stop Alarm button for effortless control

Set it once, use it forever.
Advanced settings stay out of the way. A family member can configure the grid once, and everyday use becomes effortless: tap a tile to start a timer. No scrolling. No confusion.

Ideal for:
* Kitchen and cooking tasks
* Users with low vision, presbyopia, or cataracts
* Anyone who prefers clearer, lower‑pitched alarm sounds
* Simple daily routines like naps, stretching, or hobbies

Grid Timer — big text, a carefully designed alarm, and simple living.
